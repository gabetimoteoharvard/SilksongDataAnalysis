Data based on Team Cherry's Hollow Knight: Silksong. All findings here are from the game's Steam reviews, of which there are currently over 100,000!

All code here is from data from the 'skong' json file, which is ommitted here due to size. The file, however, can be obtained
by running the code in 'main.py.'
